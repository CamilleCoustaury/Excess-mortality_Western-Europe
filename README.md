# Patterns and drivers of Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 13 Western European countries

# Summary
A group of experts from 13 Western European countries met in September 2023 to discuss patterns in age and sex-standardised cumulative excess mortality in their countries during the first thirty months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a timeline analysis, we identified notable differences in seeding events, particularly in early 2020. Lower excess mortality was associated with implementing stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) when hospital admissions were still low in 2020, and rapid roll-out of vaccines in the elderly in early 2021. Countries which implemented NPIs while hospital admissions were low tended to experience lower GDP losses in 2020. Structural factors, such as high trust in the national government and low ratio of population at risk of poverty were also associated with lower excess mortality. Further analyses are required at a more granular level to better understand how these factors impacted excess mortality and help guide pandemic preparedness plans.
